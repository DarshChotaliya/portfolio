## How to Deploy (Get a Live Link)

To send a live link to HR, you need to host this website. The easiest and most professional free method is **Netlify**.

### Option 1: Netlify Drop (Easiest)
1. Go to [app.netlify.com/drop](https://app.netlify.com/drop).
2. Drag and drop the `portfolio` folder from your Desktop into the browser window.
3. Netlify will upload it and give you a live URL (e.g., `https://random-name.netlify.app`).
4. You can change the site name in "Site Settings" to something like `darsh-portfolio.netlify.app`.

### Option 2: GitHub Pages (If you use GitHub)
1. Create a new repository on GitHub.
2. Push this code to the repository.
3. Go to Settings > Pages and enable GitHub Pages.

## Customizing
- Edit `index.html` to change text.
- Edit `style.css` to change colors.
